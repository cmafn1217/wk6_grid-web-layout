                    What I'd Like To Accomplish

            <ol>
                <li>I love to compare and contrast pens
                    of different brands. A recent find is
                    that Japanese pens are seem to be
                    designed based on certain aspects
                    such as grip or the type of paper it
                    should be used on.</li>
                <li>I love solving puzzles. Riddles, games, or physical puzzles such as the 3x3 and 4x4 Rubik's Cube.</li>

            <p>My final website would probably be called "CtrlChris". A twist
                on the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C. Although depending on the requirements 
                for the final, I might change it.
